## Description:
First choose your level (extreme is possible to win, my friend checked it out!). Then choose the option with sound (I recommend - Retrowave atmosphere) or without.Control with the keyboard (a virtual version appears on your phone). Now you can play. The higher the speed, the higher the coin multiplier, and it gets more difficult.  Depending on the difficulty of level, the size of the board and the speed of the multiplier changes. Try to get 100 coins to win, good luck!
